## Future builds


## Deployment

1. Ensure all the dependencies are included by adding them to the requirements.txt file by running the following command in the terminal: pip3 freeze > requirements.tx
2. Ensure the project has been fully committed and pushed to git 
3. Go to your heroku account, if you don't have one create one
4. On the home screen click on the create new app button
5. Enter a name for the project and select your region to the correct region.
6. On the next screen select settings
7. Go to config vars and click reveal config vars
8. Switch to the program file and where you are keeping your credentials copy these and then on heroku enter a name for the key and paste the code into the config vars value box and click add
9. Now scroll down to buildPacks and click add build packs
10. First select python and click save changes
11. Click back into build packs and choose node.js and click save again
12. Ensure that the Python  build pack is at the top of the list you are abe to drag and drop if you need to rearrange
13. Now select deploy
14. From the deployment method select GitHub
15. Then click on the connect to github button that appears
16. Click into the search box and search for the project name
16. Once located select connect
17. Then click deploy branch, this will then be shown in the box below
18. You can the click view to show the app in a browser

The program can be deployed automatically but i have chosen to keep it as a manual deploy so i can ensure that while i am testing and have no intention of adding more to the code currently it is better to deploy it manually meaning returning to the screen and clicking deploy branch each time you want to make any changes.
